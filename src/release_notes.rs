//! Hand-curated "IN THIS RELEASE" highlights for the welcome panel.
//!
//! These describe, in plain language, what shipped in the current version:
//! new features and fixed bugs. They are baked straight into the binary as
//! data, so the welcome panel needs zero network and never shells out to
//! `git log` or a forge API — the list is an accurate property of the build.
//!
//! Update [`RELEASE_NOTES`] on every version bump so the panel always tells
//! the truth about what the running binary ships (see the project memory
//! "always populate release narratives after every build"). Newest / most
//! notable highlight first; keep each summary to one short sentence.
//!
//! REPLACE this list on every bump; do not append. The panel describes the
//! single version it is baked into (`v{CARGO_PKG_VERSION}`), not a running
//! changelog. Each patch bump is one change, so the list is usually one entry:
//! what this bump fixed or added, and nothing carried over from prior versions.
